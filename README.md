making a Valentines present for the lady


This code might only work in CodePen, actually it's probable. But I'm coding so I wanted to add it to the ol' github. It started off as me trying to make a leaf just to see if I could. That worked, so I decided to make a plant for Courtney. I'll take a screenshot when I"m done and give it to her for Valentines Day. Just a silly, fun little gift. Super rewarding to make for sure.

Making this on the tails of my Jumpstart course at NSS.
